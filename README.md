# Big-Data
Creating a complete and functional Big Data system from scratch with Python, Node.js, and MySQL bucketing involves a complex process that can't be covered in a single code snippet.

Python Data Generator:
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Update the Python script with the appropriate MySQL connection details (host, user, password) in the pymysql.connect() function.
Run the Python script to generate and insert sample data into the MySQL database.
             
            python python_data_generator.py

Node.js API for Data Retrieval:
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
Navigate to the directory where the Node.js script is saved.
Install the necessary packages by running:
         
           npm install express mysql
          
Run the Node.js application to start the API server:
        
          node nodejs_data_api.js
